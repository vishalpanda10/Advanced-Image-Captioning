# Advanced Image Captioning with Neural Architectural Enhancements(CNN, LSTM, and Transformers)


## Description

This repository contains the implementation of an Image Captioning model that uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers. The project aims to generate descriptive captions for images, enhancing the results by incorporating Transformer components.

## Features
- Utilizes pre-trained CNNs for feature extraction.
- Implements LSTM for sequence generation.
- Enhancements made with Transformer components to achieve better results.

## Results

Our model achieved the following performance scores:
- BLEU-4 score: 25
- ROUGE-L F1 Score: 48.5
